# Traffic-Sign-Detector
this contains files about Traffic Sign Detector

Project Description:

Self-driving cars are a hot topic in the automotive industry. One of the key features of these vehicles is their ability to detect traffic signs, which helps to ensure the safety of both passengers and pedestrians. To implement this capability, our project utilized the OpenCV Python library and the Keras machine learning algorithm within a Jupyter Notebook editor. I used deep learning techniques, specifically the Single Shot Detector (SSD) architecture, to accurately and quickly detect traffic signs in real-time camera footage. We also applied transfer learning principles to classify and interpret the meaning of the detected signs. Our goal is to achieve maximum precision and recall on test data with our model.
